# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The application now has a sophisticated accuracy enhancement pipeline with multiple algorithms, validation stages, and confidence scoring. Users need visibility into this decision-making process to understand how results are generated, which algorithms are running, and the accuracy/confidence of the data. This feature will create a comprehensive UI to visualize the pipeline flow and provide transparency into the optimization process.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user optimizing my ad budget, I want to see the decision pipeline flow in real-time, so that I can understand how my allocation recommendations are being generated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I submit an optimization request THEN the system SHALL display a visual pipeline showing each stage of processing
2. WHEN each algorithm runs THEN the system SHALL show the current stage with progress indicators
3. WHEN the pipeline completes THEN the system SHALL display the final flow with all stages marked as complete

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see confidence scores and accuracy metrics for my optimization results, so that I can assess the reliability of the recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN optimization completes THEN the system SHALL display overall confidence scores for the allocation
2. WHEN multiple algorithms are used THEN the system SHALL show individual algorithm confidence scores
3. WHEN validation warnings exist THEN the system SHALL prominently display data quality concerns
4. WHEN benchmark comparisons are made THEN the system SHALL show deviation scores and stability metrics

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see which specific algorithms contributed to my results, so that I can understand the methodology behind the recommendations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN ensemble methods are used THEN the system SHALL display which algorithms were combined
2. WHEN Bayesian optimization runs THEN the system SHALL show convergence metrics and iteration counts
3. WHEN gradient optimization is applied THEN the system SHALL display optimization steps and performance improvements
4. WHEN LLM validation occurs THEN the system SHALL show validation results and reasoning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see alternative allocation options with their confidence scores, so that I can choose between different optimization approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple valid allocations exist THEN the system SHALL display top alternative options
2. WHEN showing alternatives THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores and expected performance
3. WHEN consensus metrics are available THEN the system SHALL show algorithm agreement levels
4. WHEN I select an alternative THEN the system SHALL explain the reasoning behind that allocation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see the data sources and citation quality that influenced my results, so that I can verify the benchmark data reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN priors data is used THEN the system SHALL display the source citations with quality indicators
2. WHEN web search citations are included THEN the system SHALL show URL validity and recency
3. WHEN benchmark validation occurs THEN the system SHALL display deviation warnings and data quality scores
4. WHEN fallback data is used THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which channels used fallback values

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export or share the pipeline visualization and metrics, so that I can document my optimization decisions for stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL provide export options for the pipeline visualization
2. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include all confidence metrics, algorithm details, and data sources
3. WHEN sharing results THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report with methodology explanation
4. WHEN printing results THEN the system SHALL format the visualization appropriately for documentation
