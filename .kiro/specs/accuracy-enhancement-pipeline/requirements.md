# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current application relies on a single Gemini API call to generate advertising benchmark data. This feature will implement a decision pipeline that combines multiple algorithms, enhanced prompting strategies, and validation techniques to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of the benchmark data results.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the advertising optimizer, I want more accurate benchmark data, so that my budget allocation decisions are based on reliable industry standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting benchmark data THEN the system SHALL use multiple data sources and validation methods to ensure accuracy
2. WHEN conflicting data is found THEN the system SHALL apply decision algorithms to determine the most reliable values
3. WHEN confidence levels are low THEN the system SHALL indicate data quality in the response

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a pipeline that can combine multiple AI responses, so that I can leverage different prompting strategies for better results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating benchmarks THEN the system SHALL use multiple LLM prompts with different approaches
2. WHEN multiple responses are received THEN the system SHALL apply consensus algorithms to merge the data
3. WHEN responses vary significantly THEN the system SHALL flag potential data quality issues

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a business user, I want company-specific benchmarks when available, so that my optimization is tailored to my industry and company size.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a specific company is provided THEN the system SHALL prioritize company-specific and industry-specific data
2. WHEN company-specific data is unavailable THEN the system SHALL fall back to industry averages with appropriate weighting
3. WHEN industry context is important THEN the system SHALL consider company size, sector, and geographic factors

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to monitor the accuracy pipeline performance, so that I can optimize the decision algorithms over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL log confidence scores and data source reliability metrics
2. WHEN accuracy issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostics for improvement
3. WHEN multiple algorithms are used THEN the system SHALL track which approaches yield the most consistent results

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want transparency about data quality, so that I can make informed decisions about using the benchmark data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN returning benchmark data THEN the system SHALL include confidence scores for each channel and metric
2. WHEN data sources conflict THEN the system SHALL indicate the level of consensus in the response
3. WHEN fallback methods are used THEN the system SHALL clearly communicate the data provenance
