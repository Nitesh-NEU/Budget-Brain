# Design Document

## Overview

This design implements an accuracy enhancement pipeline that improves budget optimization results through multiple validation approaches, ensemble methods, and enhanced confidence scoring. The pipeline will run additional algorithms alongside the existing Monte Carlo optimization to provide more reliable and accurate recommendations.

## Architecture

The enhanced optimization flow will follow this pattern:

1. **Primary Optimization**: Run existing Monte Carlo optimization
2. **Validation Pipeline**: Execute additional validation algorithms
3. **Ensemble Analysis**: Compare and combine results from multiple approaches
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Calculate reliability metrics for recommendations
5. **Result Enhancement**: Provide enriched response with accuracy metadata

## Components and Interfaces

### AccuracyEnhancementService

Main service orchestrating the enhancement pipeline:

```typescript
interface AccuracyEnhancementService {
  enhanceOptimization(
    budget: number,
    priors: ChannelPriors,
    assumptions: Assumptions,
    options: EnhancementOptions
  ): Promise<EnhancedModelResult>
}

interface EnhancementOptions {
  level: 'fast' | 'standard' | 'thorough';
  includeAlternatives: boolean;
  validateAgainstBenchmarks: boolean;
}
```

### ValidationAlgorithms

Collection of alternative optimization approaches:

```typescript
interface ValidationAlgorithms {
  // Gradient-based optimization for comparison
  gradientOptimization(budget: number, priors: ChannelPriors, assumptions: Assumptions): OptimizationResult
  
  // Bayesian optimization approach
  bayesianOptimization(budget: number, priors: ChannelPriors, assumptions: Assumptions): OptimizationResult
  
  // Rule-based validation using industry heuristics
  heuristicValidation(allocation: Allocation, priors: ChannelPriors): ValidationResult
  
  // Cross-validation using different sampling methods
  crossValidation(budget: number, priors: ChannelPriors, assumptions: Assumptions): ValidationResult
}
```

### EnsembleService

Combines results from multiple algorithms:

```typescript
interface EnsembleService {
  combineResults(results: OptimizationResult[]): EnsembledResult
  calculateConsensus(allocations: Allocation[]): ConsensusMetrics
  detectOutliers(results: OptimizationResult[]): OutlierAnalysis
  weightResults(results: OptimizationResult[], confidenceScores: number[]): Allocation
}
```

### ConfidenceScoring

Calculates reliability metrics:

```typescript
interface ConfidenceScoring {
  calculateAllocationConfidence(allocation: Allocation, validationResults: ValidationResult[]): number
  assessResultStability(results: OptimizationResult[]): StabilityMetrics
  benchmarkComparison(allocation: Allocation, industryBenchmarks: ChannelPriors): BenchmarkAnalysis
}
```

### LLMValidator

Uses additional LLM calls for result validation:

```typescript
interface LLMValidator {
  validateAllocation(allocation: Allocation, context: OptimizationContext): Promise<LLMValidationResult>
  explainRecommendation(allocation: Allocation, assumptions: Assumptions): Promise<string>
  flagPotentialIssues(allocation: Allocation, priors: ChannelPriors): Promise<ValidationWarning[]>
}
```

## Data Models

### Enhanced Response Schema

```typescript
interface EnhancedModelResult extends ModelResult {
  confidence: {
    overall: number; // 0-1 confidence score
    perChannel: Record<Channel, number>;
    stability: number; // How consistent results are across methods
  };
  validation: {
    alternativeAlgorithms: AlgorithmResult[];
    consensus: ConsensusMetrics;
    benchmarkComparison: BenchmarkAnalysis;
    warnings: ValidationWarning[];
  };
  alternatives: {
    topAllocations: Allocation[];
    reasoningExplanation: string;
  };
}

interface AlgorithmResult {
  name: string;
  allocation: Allocation;
  confidence: number;
  performance: number;
}

interface ConsensusMetrics {
  agreement: number; // How much algorithms agree (0-1)
  variance: Record<Channel, number>; // Variance in channel allocations
  outlierCount: number;
}
```

## Error Handling

### Validation Pipeline Failures

- **Algorithm Failures**: Continue with available algorithms, log failures
- **LLM Validation Errors**: Proceed without LLM validation, flag in response
- **Timeout Handling**: Implement timeouts for each validation step
- **Partial Results**: Return results with reduced confidence when some validations fail

### Performance Considerations

- **Parallel Execution**: Run validation algorithms concurrently
- **Caching**: Cache validation results for similar inputs
- **Adaptive Complexity**: Adjust validation depth based on enhancement level
- **Resource Limits**: Set maximum execution time and memory usage

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- **ValidationAlgorithms**: Test each algorithm with known inputs and expected outputs
- **EnsembleService**: Verify result combination logic and outlier detection
- **ConfidenceScoring**: Test confidence calculation with various scenarios

### Integration Tests

- **Full Pipeline**: Test complete enhancement pipeline with real optimization data
- **Performance Tests**: Verify response times meet requirements for each enhancement level
- **Accuracy Tests**: Compare enhanced results against known benchmarks

### Test Scenarios

1. **High Consensus**: All algorithms agree on similar allocations
2. **Low Consensus**: Algorithms produce conflicting recommendations
3. **Outlier Detection**: One algorithm produces significantly different results
4. **Benchmark Deviation**: Recommendations differ significantly from industry norms
5. **Performance Constraints**: Test behavior under time and resource limits
